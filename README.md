## About

### What does IYANA stand for?

IYANA is an abbreviation, the first part of the famous saying "If You Are Not Angry you are not paying attention."

### What does that have to do with a mood analysis app?

Most resources about well-being and mental health want you to simply be happy, let go of all the troubling thoughts and the anger. Some of them just want you to get back to normal so that you can become a "productive" part of the society again.

The mindset behind this app is different:

1. It's ok to be angry. In fact, if you look at all the stuff happening in the world, how can you not be angry?
2. It's not (only) your fault, if you are in a phase of bad mood or crisis. All the competition, injustice, isolation and exploitation inherent in the capitalistic world order, that is dominating our lives, is responsible not only for misery but also for an increase in depressions around the world (see e.g.http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/for-80-years-young-americans-have-been-getting-more-anxious-and-depressed.html).
3. You don't need to get better to be more productive. If you want, you can try to get better to be able to enjoy more of your life, to do more of those things that you care about, and maybe, when feeling strong enough, even to make the world a little bit better.

### A Better World?

Is there alternative? Is that even possible? You can find more thoughts about the transformation into societies with less pressure and less injustice and less mental issues here http://transform-social.org.
