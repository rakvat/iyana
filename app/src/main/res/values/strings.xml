    <string name="settings_help">You can select up to 10 factors that you want to track every day.
        You should choose factors that you think might have an influence on your mood or be influenced by your mood.\n
        \n
        The factors should be trackable by entering values from good to bad (++, +, +-, -, --).\n
        \n
        Examples are weather, sleep, sports, food, completed daily plan, meditation. You could also
        add menstruation if you think it might have an influence on your mood. In that case you could
        skip that question most of the days and only answer it when you get your period.

        You can add more factors or change them by going to Settings.\n

        ++ means very good\n
        + means good\n
        +- means neutral, neither good nor bad\n

        You do not have to answer every row each time.\n

        It might help to write down some notes with your definition for ++, +, +-, -, -- for mood and other factors. That way your answers can get more consistant.

    <string name="time_chart_help">This chart shows your mood over time. It also shows the additional factors you are tracking.
        This allows you to watch mood changes over time and understand possible causes of mood changes by looking at patterns.
        Maybe you are in a bad mood one day after eating bad or one week before menstruation?\n
        \n
        Once you have collected more than one week of data, you can move through the time by touching the chart and moving in horizontal direction.\n
        \n
        You can read the notes you have taken when entering data by touching data points in the graph.
    </string>
    <string name="mood_chart_help">Here you can see how your mood is influenced by the factors you are tracking (or how your mood influences these factors). This is called correlation.
        There is one chart for each factor. You can navigate through them by swiping the left and right.
        The x-axis is always the mood and the y-axis the factor.\n
        \n
        These charts only show values of the last 30 days. Older values are fading to white. If there are multiple
        entries in the database with the same values, they are shown as stacks of squares.\n
        \n
        What does that tell you? Let\'s say you are tracking the factor sleep and looking at that chart. If the squares are distributed randomly over the whole chart,
        then there is probably no relation between your mood and your sleep. If you see most the squares close to a diagonal from the left bottom to the right top,
        you can conclude that your mood tends to be better when you slept well. However, it\'s also possible that you don\'t sleep well when you are in a bad mood.
        (It\'s also possible that you tend to enter a bad value for sleep if you are in a bad mood even though you slept well.)
        That\'s something the data can\'t tell you, but you might know or learn that yourself if you track and reflect your mood over time.

        <b>Motivation for this App</b>\n

        \n
        <b>Disclaimer</b>\n
        If you are experiencing acute severe depressions or other forms of mental distress that is preventing you to live your normal life, please find professional help.
        Call a friend, a crisis hotline, a doctor, psychologist or psychiatrist. Be careful with spiritual anti-crisis offers. People offering the often don\'t have profound training
        and you might need more than fairy tales and hanky-panky.\n
        \n
        Remember, you are not alone. Thousands of people go through these very bad moods and thousands
        of people are out there to help. IYANA is not meant to help in acute crisis but it can be one of your tools for preventing crisis.\n
        \n
        <b>Bad Mood and Crisis Prevention</b>\n
        To prevent phases of bad mood or crisis that keep you from being able to live the life you want to live, it is good to get to know your moods,
        feelings, needs, triggers and coping mechanisms better.\n
        \n
        The About Section of this app has some more thoughts about the reasons behind bad moods and bad feelings.
        One good collection of resources about handling crisis is this page http://theicarusproject.net/welcome-to-the-crisis-toolkit/.\n
        \n
        One basic advice to prevent crisis: Track your mood daily. You can use IYANA or some other tool for this purpose. Write down a crisis plan. It should list
        multiple levels of bad mood, describe you feel in each level so that you can identify, which level you are in, and list coping mechanismis for each level,
        that should help you to get back into better mood. Here is a very short example, just to give you an idea how such a plan could look like. Your plan should be waaaaay
        more detailed.\n
        ++: Everything is good. ⇒ Keep going and enjoy.\n
        +: Ok, but not super happy. Troubling thoughts. ⇒ Meditate, cook.\n
        +-: Kind of bad. Unmotivated, can\'t concentrate. ⇒ Sports.\n
        -: Bad. Feeling depressed. ⇒ Meet friends, get rest.\n
        --: Very bad. Breakdown. Not able to do anything. ⇒ Take some time off, get professional help.\n
        \n

    <string name="about">
        <b>What does IYANA stand for?</b>\n
        IYANA is an abbreviation, the first part of the famous saying "If You Are Not Angry, you are not paying attention."\n
        \n
        <b>What does that have to do with a mood analysis app?</b>\n
        Most resources about well-being and mental health want you to simply be happy, let go of all the troubling thoughts and the anger.
        Some of them just want you to get back to normal so that you can become a "productive" part of the society again.\n
        \n
        The mindset behind this app is different: \n
        1. It\'s ok to be angry. In fact, if you look at all the stuff happening in the world, how can you not be angry?\n
        2. It\'s not (only) your fault, if you are in a phase of bad mood or crisis. All the competition, injustice, isolation and exploitation inherent in the capitalistic
        world order, that is dominating our lives, is responsible not only for misery but also for an increase in depressions around the world
        (see e.g.http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/for-80-years-young-americans-have-been-getting-more-anxious-and-depressed.html).\n
        3. You don\'t need to get better to be more productive. If you want, you can try to get better to be able
        to enjoy more of your life, to do more of those things that you care about, and maybe, when feeling strong enough, even to make the world a little bit better. \n
        \n
        <b>A Better World?</b>\n
        Is there alternative? Is that even possible? You can find more thoughts about the transformation into societies with less
        pressure and less injustice and less mental issues here http://transform.social.
