    <string name="settings_help">You can select up to 10 factors that you want to track every day.
        You should choose factors that you think might have an influence on your mood or be influenced by your mood.\n
        \n
        The factors should be trackable by entering values from good to bad (++, +, +-, -, --).\n
        \n
        Examples are weather, sleep, sports, food, completed daily plan, meditation. You could also
        add menstruation if you think it might have an influence on your mood. In that case you could
        skip that question most of the days and only answer it when you get your period.

    <string name="enter_data_help">Here you can enter your current mood and the other factors you wanted to track.
        You can add more factors or change them by going to Settings.\n
        \n
        ++ means very good\n
        + means good\n
        +- means neutral, neither good nor bad\n
        - means bad\n
        -- means very bad\n
        \n
        You do not have to answer every row each time.\n
        \n
        It might help to write down some notes with your definition for ++, +, +-, -, -- for mood and other factors. That way your answers can get more consistant.

    <string name="time_chart_help">This chart shows your mood over time. It also shows the additional factors you are tracking.
        This allows you to watch mood changes over time and understand possible causes of mood changes by looking at patterns.
        Maybe you are in a bad mood one day after eating bad or one week before menstruation?\n
        \n
        Once you have collected more than one week of data, you can move through the time by touching the chart and moving in horizontal direction.\n
        \n
        You can read the notes you have taken when entering data by touching data points in the graph.
    </string>
    <string name="mood_chart_help">Here you can see how your mood is influenced by the factors you are tracking (or how your mood influences these factors). This is called correlation.
        There is one chart for each factor. You can navigate through them by swiping the left and right.
        The x-axis is always the mood and the y-axis the factor.\n
        \n
        These charts only show values of the last 30 days. Older values are fading to white. If there are multiple
        entries in the database with the same values, they are shown as stacks of squares.\n
        \n
        What does that tell you? Let\'s say you are tracking the factor sleep and looking at that chart. If the squares are distributed randomly over the whole chart,
        then there is probably no relation between your mood and your sleep. If you see most the squares close to a diagonal from the left bottom to the right top,
        you can conclude that your mood tends to be better when you slept well. However, it\'s also possible that you don\'t sleep well when you are in a bad mood.
        (It\'s also possible that you tend to enter a bad value for sleep if you are in a bad mood even though you slept well.)
        That\'s something the data can\'t tell you, but you might know or learn that yourself if you track and reflect your mood over time.
